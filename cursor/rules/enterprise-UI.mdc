🖥️ Enterprise UI Design Characteristics
Typography

Clean, sans‑serif fonts (Segoe UI, Roboto, Inter) with consistent sizing hierarchy.

Clear distinction between headings, subheadings, and body text.

Avoid playful or overly rounded fonts — stick to sharp, modern typefaces.

Color Palette

Neutral base (white, gray, charcoal) with restrained accent colors (blue, green, or brand‑specific).

High contrast for readability, but subtle gradients or flat tones for polish.

Consistent use of brand colors across buttons, links, and highlights.

Layout

Grid‑based, responsive design with clear spacing and alignment.

Navigation that’s predictable: top bar or left sidebar, not floating or hidden.

Content areas that emphasize clarity over decoration.

UI Elements

Buttons: rectangular or slightly rounded, with strong contrast and clear labels.

Forms: aligned labels, consistent input sizes, validation feedback that’s subtle but visible.

Tables: clean borders, alternating row shading, sortable headers.

Cards: minimal shadow, sharp edges — avoid “pill” shapes unless brand‑mandated.

Interaction

Hover states that are subtle (color shift, underline) rather than flashy animations.

Loading indicators that are professional (spinners, progress bars) instead of cartoonish.

Error/success messages styled consistently with brand colors.

Accessibility

WCAG‑compliant contrast ratios.

Keyboard navigation and ARIA roles for screen readers.

Scalable font sizes and responsive layouts for different devices.
